Critical Path Method (CPM)
Task Dependencies and Durations

| ID | Task                      | Duration | Depends On |
| -- | ------------------------- | -------- | ---------- |
| A  | Setup Project & Tools     | 1 day    | —          |
| B  | Authentication Module     | 2 days   | A          |
| C  | Event CRUD                | 3 days   | B          |
| D  | Ticket System             | 2 days   | C          |
| E  | Local Storage Integration | 1 day    | C          |
| F  | Pop-ups + Responsive UI   | 2 days   | D, E       |
| G  | Testing & Debugging       | 2 days   | F          |
| H  | Finalization & Docs       | 1 day    | G          |

Critical Path
A → B → C → D → F → G → H
Total Duration: 12 working days

E (Local Storage) is not on the critical path but runs parallel to D. Delay in E can only affect F.
